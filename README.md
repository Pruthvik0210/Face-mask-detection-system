# Face-mask-detection-system

I did this project under machine learning subject at university of texas at arlington as my final project.

check the ipynb file to get an idea of how I created prediction model my_model.h5, and the face_mask.py file where I have created a simple UI to test my model usking tkinter of python. enter the image path in the URL textbox and click on the button it will show weather people in that image are wearing mask or not.
